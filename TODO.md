# todo

- train a different model on the peass data (which was removed in PR #3, commit `7ad923b3` on 2026-06-06 17:01)
  - get more data from https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/2019-WASPAA-SEBASS
- use peass decomposition as an ablation for haspi metrics
- note to self: add `-n auto` for pycharm to speed up tests,
  examples here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/performing-tests.html#run-tests-in-parallel
- add reflection padding milliseconds as a configurable option, it's helpful for short files (especially under 1s), 
  see `test_torch_decomposition.py:test_torch_decomposition_gain_invariance_with_padding` for details
